Almost a year after I created my first blog post on moving to Octopress, I
remembered about it. To be honest, I never really bothered to read about
Octopress properly and thus, quite simply forgot how to add new posts/create
pages once I changed my laptop. (yup, this is exactly why my first post was a How-To
guide)

## Getting started. Again.

Thing about blogging is, that it's only interesting if you do it regularly. And
after a long time, I've felt the desire to put my writing out in the public
domain. Maybe it will make you laugh, maybe it might teach you something. It
will definitely give me something to do!

I am planning to write regularly now. What will I write about? Mostly things
that I read, links that I find useful and sometimes, code.

Why sometimes code? Because 
 - There are plenty more talented people than me out there
 - I haven't really mastered anything so well to be able to write those

Still, I will write on topics which I find out about and no better
resource/book already exists on the same.

### Things I am working on

In no specific order:

 - Android app : A lot left to learn here. Planning to release an app in
     production soon

 - Django open source : I've learned a lot of Django over the last two years
     and created plenty of code. But there is room for a lot of improvement.
     Maybe creating and releasing an open source module/app will help enhance
     my learning further.

 - Proper routine : After having tried and failed at organization for ages,
     maybe I will succeed this time? 

### Recommended links

Below are some good links 

 - Why I have my own website
 [http://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html ]
 Admittedly, the main motivation for me to start writing again. 

 - Calvin and Hobbes - Not a link exactly but something that's a must read
    anyhow. I had read 1 or two strips randomly but never really gotten the
    essence of this comic. Now, having read a lot of them in one go, I can say
    that Bill Watterson has created a character that is trully legendary. If
    only we were all as imaginative :)
