    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost a year after I created my first blog post on moving to Octopress, I
remembered about it. To be honest, I never really bothered to read about
Octopress properly and thus, quite simply forgot how to add new posts/create
pages once I changed my laptop. (yup, this is exactly why my first post was a How-To
guide)</p>

<h2>Getting started. Again.</h2>

<p>Thing about blogging is, that it&rsquo;s only interesting if you do it regularly. And
after a long time, I&rsquo;ve felt the desire to put my writing out in the public
domain. Maybe it will make you laugh, maybe it might teach you something. It
will definitely give me something to do!</p>

<p>I am planning to write regularly now. What will I write about? Mostly things
that I read, links that I find useful and sometimes, code.</p>

<p>Why sometimes code? Because
 - There are plenty more talented people than me out there
 - I haven&rsquo;t really mastered anything so well to be able to write those</p>

<p>Still, I will write on topics which I find out about and no better
resource/book already exists on the same.</p>

<h3>Things I am working on</h3>

<p>In no specific order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Android app : A lot left to learn here. Planning to release an app in
  production soon</p></li>
<li><p>Django open source : I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of Django over the last two years
  and created plenty of code. But there is room for a lot of improvement.
  Maybe creating and releasing an open source module/app will help enhance
  my learning further.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper routine : After having tried and failed at organization for ages,
  maybe I will succeed this time?</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Recommended links</h3>

<p>Below are some good links</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why I have my own website
[<a href="http://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html">http://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html</a> ]
Admittedly, the main motivation for me to start writing again.</p></li>
<li><p>Calvin and Hobbes - Not a link exactly but something that&rsquo;s a must read
 anyhow. I had read 1 or two strips randomly but never really gotten the
 essence of this comic. Now, having read a lot of them in one go, I can say
 that Bill Watterson has created a character that is trully legendary. If
 only we were all as imaginative :)</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, so I know there are a lot of resources which detail how to move your blog
over to octopress. I just did the same thing today. Since, I faced some
difficulties while doing this, I think this might be a good topic to start my
blog off with. So let’s get started with creating your blog.</p>

<h2>Installing Octopress</h2>

<p>To install Octopress on your system, you need Git and Ruby installed on your
machine. Both these packages can be installed using various package managers
such as yum and apt-get. Now clone the Octopress repository from Github. Run
the following commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
</span><span class='line'>cd octopress
</span><span class='line'>gem install bundler #package manager for ruby
</span><span class='line'>bundle install   # installs all the dependencies for Octopress
</span><span class='line'>rake install     # installs octopress</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Some points about the above commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you get an error Net::HTTPServerException with some other messages, open the
Gemfile and replace <a href="https://rubygems.org">https://rubygems.org</a> with <a href="http://rubygems.org.">http://rubygems.org.</a> This should
resolve that issue</li>
<li>Don’t be root when doing bundle install. This will prohibit any other user from
using Octopress.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Basic setup details</h2>

<p>All the configuration information for your blog is stored in <code>_config.yml</code> file.
Here you can define the name of your blog, the url, the author, link github id
and gmail ids etc. Browse through the file once.</p>

<p>To create a new page (eg: About me) run</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake new_page[About]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This creates a new directory <code>About</code> inside the <code>source</code> directory. This directory
has a file named <code>index.markdown</code>. Use it to add content to your file.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>To create your first blog post</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To generate and preview the blog</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake generate
</span><span class='line'>rake preview</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Head over to <code>http://localhost:4000</code> to see your first blog!</p>

<h2>Deploying the blog to Github</h2>

<p>First of all, create a repository of the form <code>[username].github.io</code> from your
Github account, where username is your Github username. For example, my github
user name is <em>SudShekhar</em>, so my github.io repository is named
<code>sudshekhar.github.io</code>.</p>

<p>Now inside the octopress folder (which we had cloned from remote), type</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake setup_github_pages</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will ask for the link of your github repository url
(git@github.com:SudShekhar/sudshekhar.github.io.git in my case). Just press
enter and voila! the entire setup is done. To push your code live, run the
following commands</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake generate
</span><span class='line'>rake deploy</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A short note about these two commands: <code>setup_github_pages</code> pushes the<code>_deploy</code>
folder to remote. The <code>source</code> folder is not pushed to remote and you need to add
it explicitly before such a step can be taken. By default, your Octopress
repository (local version) remains in <code>source</code> branch. Thus, only the <em>_deploy</em>
will be pushed to remote.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you face any other issues. I will be glad to help :)</p>
